                  First and foremost, when you contribute to a cause you are making the world a better place.
                  Whether you are donating your time, money or expertise, there are recipients benefiting from it.
                  People may go to school because of the scholarship you fund, children may feel supported by the
                  shelter or food they receive, animals may be saved because of the organization you donate too,
                  and society carbon footprint may decrease as a result of your research and efforts.
                  Ultimately, giving back shows kindness and those around you see that.

                  While sometimes there are questions about where money goes in the public sector, the fact is,
                  everyone in it is trying to do something bigger than what one of us could do alone.
                  The fact is this: when you donate to charity you are doing good in the world.
